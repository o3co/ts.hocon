# HOCON Spec Compliance — ts.hocon

This file extends the canonical item definitions in [`xx.hocon/docs/spec-checklist.md`](../../xx.hocon/docs/spec-checklist.md). It inherits all 209 items in the same order, adding `tests:` and `status:` fields for this implementation.

- **`tests:`** — placeholder; actual test-path mapping is a separate later phase. All cells read `—` until that phase runs.
- **`status:`** — uses the glyphs defined in the template legend (✅ ⚠️ ❌ 🤷 ➖). Default is 🤷 (no test, unverified).
- **Compliance rate** — computed as `(✅ + ⚠️·0.5) / total` (spec-total) and `(✅ + ⚠️·0.5) / (total − ➖)` (in-scope). See the template for the full convention. Current rollup is not yet computed (all items still at 🤷 or ➖ except where pre-populated below).
- **Out-of-scope items** — inherited verbatim from the template; `status: ➖`.
- **Pre-population source** — GitHub issues on [o3co/ts.hocon](https://github.com/o3co/ts.hocon) verified at time of writing; see individual items for links.

Section headings (S1–S26) match the template exactly for cross-impl matrix alignment.

## S1. Unchanged from JSON

- **S1.1** Files must be valid UTF-8 — §Unchanged from JSON (L117)
  tests: —
  status: 🤷
- **S1.2.1** Quoted strings accept valid JSON escape sequences (`\" \\ \/ \b \f \n \r \t`) — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
  tests: —
  status: 🤷
- **S1.2.2** Unknown / invalid escape sequence (e.g. `\q`, `\x`) is rejected — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)

  tests: —
  status: 🤷
- **S1.2.4** Unescaped control char / raw newline in quoted string is rejected — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
  tests: —
  status: 🤷
- **S1.2.5** Unterminated quoted string is rejected — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
  tests: —
  status: 🤷
- **S1.2.6** Unpaired UTF-16 surrogate codepoint in `\uXXXX` escape — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
  out-of-scope: intentional language-natural divergence. Java (Lightbend reference) silently accepts unpaired surrogates because Java strings are 16-bit code-unit sequences; Rust `char` and Go `rune` cannot represent them and reject. xx.hocon conformance fixtures cannot cover this case (the Java generator fails to encode unpaired surrogates as UTF-8 when writing expected JSON). Each implementation follows its language's string-type constraints. Documented in xx.hocon commit 86bd82e.

## S16. MIME Type

- **S16.1** Content-Type for HOCON resources is `application/hocon` — §MIME Type (L1223)
  out-of-scope: these implementations are parsers, not HTTP servers — they do not produce or advertise a Content-Type. The header is set by whoever serves a `.conf` file over HTTP.

## S22. Config object merging API

  tests: —
  status: 🤷
- **S23.5** Multi-line values (backslash continuation) — §Note on Java properties similarity (L1587)
  out-of-scope: declared in each implementation's README — the `.properties` reader supports only basic `key=value` syntax to avoid pulling a full Java properties parser into a non-JVM library.
  tests: —
  status: ➖
- **S23.6** Unicode escapes in `.properties` — §Note on Java properties similarity (L1587)

## S24. Conventional config files (JVM)

  status: ➖

## S25. System property override

- **S25.1** System properties override config file values — §Conventional override (L1530)
  out-of-scope: JVM system properties are a JVM-only mechanism; non-JVM runtimes use environment variables or library-specific overrides.

  tests: —
  status: 🤷
- **S26.3** Env var SecurityException → treated as not present — §Substitution fallback (L1560)

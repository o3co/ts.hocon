# HOCON Spec Compliance — ts.hocon

This file extends the canonical item definitions in [`xx.hocon/docs/spec-checklist.md`](https://github.com/o3co/xx.hocon/blob/main/docs/spec-checklist.md). It inherits all 209 items in the same order, adding `tests:` and `status:` fields for this implementation.

- **`tests:`** — path to the test or fixture exercising each item, or `—` when no test covers it (test debt).
- **`status:`** — uses the glyphs defined in the template legend (✅ ⚠️ ❌ 🤷 ➖). Default is 🤷 (no test, unverified).
- **Compliance rate** — computed as `(✅ + ⚠️·0.5) / total` (spec-total) and `(✅ + ⚠️·0.5) / (total − ➖)` (in-scope). See the [template](https://github.com/o3co/xx.hocon/blob/main/docs/spec-checklist.md) for the full convention and the [cross-impl matrix](https://github.com/o3co/xx.hocon/blob/main/docs/compliance-matrix.md) for the current ts.hocon rollup. The matrix is the source of truth for current counts; intra-file rollups would drift.
- **Out-of-scope items** — inherited verbatim from the template; `status: ➖`.
- **Pre-population source** — GitHub issues on [o3co/ts.hocon](https://github.com/o3co/ts.hocon) verified at time of writing; see individual items for links.

Section headings (S1–S26) match the template exactly for cross-impl matrix alignment.

## S1. Unchanged from JSON

- **S1.1** Files must be valid UTF-8 — §Unchanged from JSON (L117)
  out-of-scope: The public `parse()` API accepts a JS `string`, which is already a decoded
  Unicode sequence — Node.js (and browsers) perform UTF-8 decoding at the I/O boundary before
  the string reaches the parser. `parseFile()` uses `fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf-8')`. Note
  that Node's default UTF-8 decoder is **non-fatal**: invalid byte sequences are silently
  replaced with U+FFFD (REPLACEMENT CHARACTER), not thrown. Strict rejection of invalid
  UTF-8 would require a custom decoder (e.g. `TextDecoder` with `{fatal: true}`) at the I/O
  layer. The HOCON parser itself cannot observe raw byte sequences and has no mechanism to
  detect or reject invalid UTF-8 — what reaches the parser layer is always a valid JS string.
  S1.1 is therefore structurally inapplicable to the parser layer in JS runtimes; honoring
  it is the caller's responsibility (provide bytes pre-validated, or wrap I/O with a strict
  decoder). xx.hocon conformance fixtures cannot test this case via the public API.
  tests: tests/config.test.ts (S1.1 describe block — sanity checks multi-byte chars accepted)
  status: ➖
- **S1.2.1** Quoted strings accept valid JSON escape sequences (`\" \\ \/ \b \f \n \r \t`) — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:49; tests/lightbend/testdata/subst-tokenize/st10-escape-newline.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S1.2.2** Unknown / invalid escape sequence (e.g. `\q`, `\x`) is rejected — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:86; tests/lightbend/testdata/subst-tokenize/st-err01-invalid-escape-x.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S1.2.3** Malformed `\uXXXX` (short / non-hex) is rejected — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:74; tests/lightbend/testdata/subst-tokenize/st-err03-invalid-unicode-short.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S1.2.4** Unescaped control char / raw newline in quoted string is rejected — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
  tests: tests/lightbend/testdata/subst-tokenize/st-err07-newline-in-string.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S1.2.5** Unterminated quoted string is rejected — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:175; tests/lightbend/testdata/subst-tokenize/st-err06-unterminated-string.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S1.2.6** Unpaired UTF-16 surrogate codepoint in `\uXXXX` escape — §Unchanged from JSON (L118)
  out-of-scope: intentional language-natural divergence. Java (Lightbend reference) silently accepts unpaired surrogates because Java strings are 16-bit code-unit sequences; Rust `char` and Go `rune` cannot represent them and reject. xx.hocon conformance fixtures cannot cover this case (the Java generator fails to encode unpaired surrogates as UTF-8 when writing expected JSON). Each implementation follows its language's string-type constraints. Documented in xx.hocon commit 86bd82e.
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:67
  status: ➖
- **S1.3** Value types: string, number, object, array, boolean, null — §Unchanged from JSON (L119)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:66
  status: ✅
- **S1.4** Number formats match JSON (no NaN, no Infinity) — §Unchanged from JSON (L120)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:64; tests/coerce.test.ts:50
  status: ✅

## S2. Comments

- **S2.1** `//` line comment — §Comments (L125)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:29
  status: ✅
- **S2.2** `#` line comment — §Comments (L125)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:36; tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv01/comments.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S2.3** Comment markers inside quoted strings are literal — §Comments (L126)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:273
  status: ✅

## S3. Omit root braces

- **S3.1** Empty file is invalid — §Omit root braces (L130)
  tests: tests/spec-s3-1-empty-file.test.ts; tests/conformance/empty-file.test.ts; tests/config.test.ts (S3.1 describe block)
  status: ✅
  notes: Fixed in Phase 6 #3h. `buildResolveContext()` in `src/parse.ts` now checks the
  token stream after `tokenize()` and throws `ParseError` if only EOF/newline tokens are
  present (covers empty, whitespace-only, comment-only, BOM-only input).
- **S3.2** Root non-object/non-array is invalid (when explicitly enclosed) — §Omit root braces (L131)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:355
  status: ✅
- **S3.3** Implicit `{}` when file does not start with `[` or `{` — §Omit root braces (L134)
  tests: tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv01/no-root-braces.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S3.4** Unbalanced trailing `}` without opening `{` is invalid — §Omit root braces (L138)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:234
  status: ❌ ([#55](https://github.com/o3co/ts.hocon/issues/55)) — related test passes but specific case (unbraced root + stray `}`) is not covered

## S4. Key-value separator

- **S4.1** `=` is interchangeable with `:` — §Key-value separator (L143)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:18; tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv01/equals.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S4.2** `:` / `=` may be omitted before `{` — §Key-value separator (L146)
  tests: tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv01/omit-colons.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅

## S5. Commas

- **S5.1** Newline acts as element/field separator — §Commas (L152)
  tests: tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv01/no-commas.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S5.2** Single trailing comma is allowed and ignored — §Commas (L155)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:304; tests/parser.test.ts:312
  status: ✅
- **S5.3** Two trailing commas (`[1,2,3,,]`) is invalid — §Commas (L160)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:319; tests/parser.test.ts:323
  status: ✅
- **S5.4** Leading comma (`[,1,2,3]`) is invalid — §Commas (L161)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:328; tests/parser.test.ts:332
  status: ✅
- **S5.5** Two consecutive commas (`[1,,2,3]`) is invalid — §Commas (L162)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:337
  status: ✅
- **S5.6** Same comma rules apply to object fields — §Commas (L163)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:342
  status: ✅

## S6. Whitespace

- **S6.1** Unicode Zs/Zl/Zp category characters are whitespace — §Whitespace (L170)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:336; tests/lexer.test.ts:343
  status: ✅ (fixed by PR fix/s6-whitespace-expansion, issue #72 resolved)
- **S6.2** Non-breaking spaces (0x00A0, 0x2007, 0x202F) are whitespace — §Whitespace (L171)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:360; tests/lexer.test.ts:367; tests/lexer.test.ts:373
  status: ✅ (fixed by PR fix/s6-whitespace-expansion, issue #72 resolved)
- **S6.3** BOM (0xFEFF) treated as whitespace — §Whitespace (L173)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:161; tests/lexer.test.ts:166; tests/lightbend/testdata/bom.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅ (broadened: BOM is now whitespace anywhere, not only at start-of-input; mid-stream test added)
- **S6.4** ASCII control whitespace (tab, vtab, FF, CR, FS, GS, RS, US) — §Whitespace (L174)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:383; tests/lexer.test.ts:389; tests/lexer.test.ts:394; tests/lexer.test.ts:400; tests/lexer.test.ts:406
  status: ✅ (fixed by PR fix/s6-whitespace-expansion, issue #72 resolved — all 8 chars now recognized)
  note — CR inside `${...}`: the S6 GREEN commit changed CR (0x0D) inside a substitution body from
  "unterminated substitution" error to "consumed as inter-segment whitespace". This is intentional per
  spec §F (newline = LF only; CR is whitespace) and is 3-way-convergent across ts/rs/go.
  Tests pinning this behavior: tests/lexer.test.ts:280 (NBSP), :287 (Zl), :294 (vtab), :301 (CR).
- **S6.5** "newline" means specifically 0x000A (LF) — §Whitespace (L183)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts (S6.5 describe block)
  status: ✅

## S7. Duplicate keys and object merging

- **S7.1** Later non-object key overrides earlier — §Duplicate keys (L189)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:56
  status: ✅
- **S7.2** Two object values are merged recursively — §Duplicate keys (L191)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:47
  status: ✅
- **S7.3** Merge: fields in only one object are kept — §Duplicate keys (L199)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:47
  status: ✅
- **S7.4** Merge: non-object field in both → second wins — §Duplicate keys (L201)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:56
  status: ✅
- **S7.5** Merge: object field in both → recursive merge — §Duplicate keys (L203)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:159; tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv02/path-keys.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S7.6** Intermediate non-object value breaks merge with later object — §Duplicate keys (L207)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts (S7.6 describe block)
  status: ✅

## S8. Unquoted strings

- **S8.1** Forbidden characters rejected (``$ " { } [ ] : = , + # ` ^ ? ! @ * & \``) and whitespace — §Unquoted strings (L245)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:191
  status: ⚠️ — cited test covers only a subset of the forbidden set; `isUnquotedStart` / `isUnquotedContinue` in src/internal/lexer/lexer.ts do not exclude `` ` `` (backtick), so the impl allows it in unquoted strings contrary to spec L245
- **S8.2** `//` inside an unquoted string starts a comment — §Unquoted strings (L248)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:29
  status: ✅
- **S8.3** Initial token `true`/`false`/`null` parsed as keyword — §Unquoted strings (L250)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:66
  status: ✅
- **S8.4** Initial number characters parse as number — §Unquoted strings (L250)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:79; tests/lexer.test.ts:117
  status: ✅
- **S8.5** Embedded `true`/`false`/`null`/number become string content — §Unquoted strings (L266)
  tests: tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv01/unquoted.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S8.6** Unquoted string cannot begin with `0-9` or `-` — §Unquoted strings (L270)
  tests: tests/s8-unquoted-starts.test.ts (16 xx.hocon fixtures + 2 path-rule regressions); tests/lexer.test.ts:423 (`-foo` rejected); tests/lexer.test.ts:419 (`123abc` documented gap)
  status: ⚠️ partial ([#73](https://github.com/o3co/ts.hocon/issues/73)) — `-` not followed by a digit is rejected at lex/parse time in three sites: the main tokenize loop's unquoted-start branch (src/internal/lexer/lexer.ts, after the `isUnquotedStart` predicate dispatches), the symmetric check in `parseSubstBody` for `${...}` path segments, and the per-segment check in `parseKey` (src/internal/parser/parser.ts) for dotted key paths. The `isUnquotedStart` predicate itself still returns `true` for `-`; rejection happens in the dispatcher. **Hyphen-with-digit** fixtures (us04 `-42`, us16 `-1foo`) continue to lex as single unquoted tokens and value-coerce; **digit-leading** unquoted strings (us01 `123abc`, us05 `123// rest`, us10–us12 `1ex`/`1.x`/`0xff`, us14 `1.0.0`) likewise remain single tokens with no separate `number` kind. The resolved value matches Lightbend value-concat output for those success cases; only the strict lex-time error semantics for `01` (us13, Lightbend silent-accept quirk) and `1e+x` (us15, Lightbend value-parser error on `+`) remain open and are tracked as `it.fails` tripwires in the conformance file. Closing those gaps requires introducing a `number` token kind (architectural change deferred until cross-impl alignment is needed).
- **S8.7** No escape sequences in unquoted strings — §Unquoted strings (L253)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:385
  status: ✅
- **S8.8** Unquoted strings allow control characters except forbidden set — §Unquoted strings (L280)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:392; tests/lexer.test.ts:399
  status: ✅

## S9. Multi-line strings

- **S9.1** `"""..."""` triple-quoted string — §Multi-line strings (L291)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:98; tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv05/triple-quotes.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S9.2** Newlines and whitespace preserved literally — §Multi-line strings (L293)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:98; tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv05/triple-quotes.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S9.3** Unicode escapes NOT interpreted inside triple-quoted — §Multi-line strings (L294)
  tests: tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv05/triple-quotes.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S9.4** Scala-style trailing extra quotes are part of string — §Multi-line strings (L300)
  tests: tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv05/triple-quotes.conf (fixture)
  status: ✅
- **S9.5** Unterminated `"""` raises an error — §Multi-line strings (L291-293, by analogy with quoted strings)
  tests: tests/lexer.test.ts:183
  status: ✅

## S10. Value concatenation

  status: ✅
- **S10.2** All arrays → array concatenation — §Value concatenation (L312)

  status: ✅
- **S10.3** All objects → object merge (concatenation) — §Value concatenation (L314)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:159
  status: ✅
- **S10.4** Mixing arrays + objects in concat is an error — §Array and object concatenation (L385)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts (S10.4 it blocks), tests/concat-errors.test.ts (ce01, ce02, ce10, ce11, ce14)
  status: ✅ — fixed in Phase 6 #3b; joinPair now throws ResolveError when numericObjectToArray returns null. Closes #75.
- **S10.5** Inner whitespace between simple values preserved — §String value concatenation (L332)
  tests: tests/lightbend/testdata/equiv01/unquoted.conf (fixture)

  status: ✅
- **S10.7** Concatenation does not span a newline — §String value concatenation (L335)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:364
  status: ✅
- **S10.8** String concat allowed in field keys — §Value concatenation (L317)
  tests: tests/parser.test.ts:381
  status: ❌ (see #76) — parser rejects unquoted-space-unquoted as key with "unexpected token after key: unquoted"
- **S10.9** `true`/`false` stringify to `"true"`/`"false"` in concat — §String value concatenation (L363)

  tests: tests/config.test.ts:172
  status: ✅
- **S10.13** Array/object appearing in string concat is an error — §String value concatenation (L373)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts (S10.13 it blocks), tests/concat-errors.test.ts (ce03, ce04, ce06, ce12, ce13)
  status: ✅ — fixed in Phase 6 #3b; joinPair now throws ResolveError for array+scalar, scalar+array, object+scalar, scalar+object. Closes #77.
- **S10.14** Whitespace around obj/array substitutions is ignored — §Concatenation with whitespace (L440)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:653,666
  status: ✅ — fixed alongside S15 concat work; `resolveConcat` array-concat branch now filters parser-inserted separator whitespace to match the existing object-concat behavior.
- **S10.15** Quoted whitespace between obj/array substitutions is an error — §Concatenation with whitespace (L442)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts (S10.13 it blocks cover object+scalar, which includes quoted-whitespace-as-scalar cases)
  status: ✅ — Phase 6 #3b raises ResolveError for object+scalar; prior wrong-pinning test removed.
- **S10.16** Non-newline whitespace in arrays is concat, not separator — §Arrays without commas or newlines (L447)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts (S10.16 describe block)
  status: ✅
- **S10.17** Substitution resolving to an array participates in array concat (`${arr} [x]`) — §Array and object concatenation (L387)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:284
  status: ✅
- **S10.18** Substitution resolving to an object participates in object merge (`${obj} {x:1}`) — §Array and object concatenation (L388)

  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts (S10.19 it blocks), tests/concat-errors.test.ts (ce07, ce08)
  status: ✅ — fixed in Phase 6 #3b; substitution-resolved values participate in same joinPair type-check as literals. Closes #79.

### S13a. Self-referential substitutions

- **S13a.1** `path : ${path}` resolves to prior `path` value — §Self-Referential (L666)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:135
  status: ✅
- **S13a.2** Self-ref to overridden field works in merge — §Self-Referential (L748)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:213
  status: ✅
- **S13a.3** Self-ref before any prior value → undefined → error — §Self-Referential (L767)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts (S13a.3 describe block)
  status: ⚠️
  notes: `a = ${a}` (no prior value) raises `ResolveError("circular substitution: a")`.
  An error is raised (correct), but spec L767-773 says this case should be treated as
  "undefined" (i.e. a missing-substitution error), not an "intractable cycle" error.
  The distinction matters for error messages and for `${?a}` handling (which the impl
  already handles correctly via separate detection). Behavior (error) is correct;
  error classification is off-spec.
- **S13a.4** Optional self-ref `${?foo}` disappears silently — §Self-Referential (L776)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:291
  status: ✅

  status: ✅
- **S13a.9** Multi-step cycle `a→b→c→a` → error — §Self-Referential (L862)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:148
  status: ✅
- **S13a.10** Substitution memoized by instance, not by path — §Self-Referential (L885)
  out-of-scope: Internal resolver implementation detail. Two `${b}` substitutions at
  different file positions naturally see the same lookup result (the final merged config)
  regardless of whether memoization is keyed by instance or by path, because the config
  is non-self-referential in any valid observable test. The spec rule constrains resolver
  internals to prevent observable differences in self-referential edge cases, but no
  black-box input/output test can distinguish "memoized by instance" from "resolved
  independently" via the public API. See resolver.test.ts comment at S13a.10 for details.
  tests: — (internal memoization semantics — not externally observable)
  status: ➖
- **S13a.11** Object can refer to its own descendant (`bar : { foo : 42, baz : ${bar.foo} }`) — §Self-Referential (L806)

  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:766, tests/s13a13-self-ref-lookback.test.ts (sr01–sr11)
  status: ✅ Fix landed in cluster 3f via resolver short-circuit when no prior value exists (see #84).
- **S13a.14** Mutually-referring object fields (`bar.a = ${foo.d}; foo.c = ${bar.b}`) resolve lazily without false cycle — §Self-Referential (L825-834)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:227
  status: ✅

### S13b. `+=` field separator

- **S13b.1** `a += b` expands to `a = ${?a} [b]` — §`+=` field separator (L725)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:67; tests/parse.test.ts:186
  status: ✅
- **S13b.2** `+=` on non-array prior value → error — §`+=` field separator (L732)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:696
  status: ❌ (see #81) — resolver wraps the scalar as a single-element array instead of erroring
- **S13b.3** `+=` works on first mention of key (no prior `=`) — §`+=` field separator (L734)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:74
  status: ✅

### S13c. List values from environment variables

- **S13c.1** `${X[]}` looks up `X_0`, `X_1`, ... env vars — §List values from env (L900)
  tests: tests/env-var-list.test.ts (ev01-basic); tests/resolver.test.ts (S13c describe block)
  status: ✅ — lexer parses `[]` suffix (src/internal/lexer/lexer.ts `parseListSuffix`); resolver scans `NAME_0`, `NAME_1`, … (src/internal/resolver/substitution-resolver.ts `resolveEnvList`). Also honours E6 (config-wins) and E7 (whitespace before `[]`).
- **S13c.2** Stops at first missing index — §List values from env (L905)
  tests: tests/env-var-list.test.ts (ev02-stops-at-gap); tests/resolver.test.ts (S13c describe block)
  status: ✅ — stop condition is key-absent (not empty-string value); empty-string elements are preserved (ev10).
- **S13c.3** `${X[]}` no elements → required error — §List values from env (L910)
  tests: tests/env-var-list.test.ts (ev03-required-no-elements, ev12a); tests/resolver.test.ts (S13c describe block)
  status: ✅ — `resolveEnvList` returns undefined when no `_0` found; caller throws ResolveError for required form.
- **S13c.4** `${?X[]}` no elements → undefined / removed — §List values from env (L912)
  tests: tests/env-var-list.test.ts (ev04-optional-no-elements, ev12b); tests/resolver.test.ts (S13c describe block)
  status: ✅ — optional form returns undefined (key removed from result object).
- **S13c.5** `[]` suffix supported only for env vars (not config / sys props) — §List values from env (L902)
  tests: tests/env-var-list.test.ts (ev12a, ev12b); tests/resolver.test.ts (S13c.5 scalar-suppression cases)
  status: ✅ — when `listSuffix=true` and no `_0` is found, resolver does NOT fall through to scalar env fallback. S13c.5 enforcement is in `resolveSubst` (src/internal/resolver/substitution-resolver.ts) — the `s.listSuffix` branch returns before the scalar env path.
  notes: E6 (config-defined wins, ev05) and E7 (whitespace before `[]`, ev09) are also implemented — see extra-spec-conventions.md.

## S15. Numerically-indexed objects to arrays

- **S15.1** `{"0":"a","1":"b"}` → `["a","b"]` when array context — §Conversion (L1191)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:440 (Phase 4 spec form, now passing); tests/numeric-array.test.ts (helper unit tests); tests/s15-numeric-obj-array.test.ts (xx.hocon na01 fixture)
  status: ✅
  `getList()` invokes `numericObjectToArray` (`src/value/numeric-array.ts`) before the type check, converting numeric-keyed objects to arrays per spec.
- **S15.2** Conversion is lazy (only on type-required access) — §Conversion (L1204)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:447; tests/s15-numeric-obj-array.test.ts (xx.hocon na02 fixture)
  status: ✅
  `get()`/`getConfig()` do not invoke `numericObjectToArray`; only list-typed accessors trigger conversion. Explicit guard, not incidental.
- **S15.3** Conversion in concatenation when list expected — §Conversion (L1210)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:454 (Phase 4 spec form, now passing); tests/s15-numeric-obj-array.test.ts (xx.hocon na03a/b/c/d/e fixtures including the NORMATIVE multi-piece left-to-right pairwise fold)
  status: ✅
  `src/internal/resolver/substitution-resolver.ts:resolveConcat` performs a true left-to-right pairwise fold (per spec §"Multi-piece concat") over non-separator resolved values — adjacent Objects are merged first via S10.3, then `numericObjectToArray` is invoked when the partner is an Array. Verified by `na03e-multi-piece-overlap.conf` (overlapping numeric keys). Note: the function no longer has a distinct "array-concat branch"; all type-pair dispatch happens inside the fold's `joinPair` helper.
- **S15.4** Empty object NOT converted — §Conversion (L1212)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:460; tests/s15-numeric-obj-array.test.ts (xx.hocon na04 fixture)
  status: ✅
  `numericObjectToArray` returns `null` on empty objects; `getList` then throws `ConfigError`. Explicit empty-guard, not incidental.
- **S15.5** Non-integer keys ignored during conversion — §Conversion (L1214)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:466; tests/s15-numeric-obj-array.test.ts (xx.hocon na05 fixture)
  status: ✅
  Pre-filter regex `^(0|[1-9][0-9]*)$` in `numericObjectToArray` rejects non-integer keys before parsing.
- **S15.6** Missing indices compacted in resulting array — §Conversion (L1216)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:472; tests/s15-numeric-obj-array.test.ts (xx.hocon na06 fixture)
  status: ✅
  After eligibility filtering and integer parsing, entries are sorted by integer ascending and projected to a value array — gaps eliminated.
- **S15.7** Sorted by integer key value — §Conversion (L1216)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:478; tests/s15-numeric-obj-array.test.ts (xx.hocon na07 fixture)
  status: ✅
  Same sort step as S15.6.

## S16. MIME Type

- **S16.1** Content-Type for HOCON resources is `application/hocon` — §MIME Type (L1223)
  out-of-scope: these implementations are parsers, not HTTP servers — they do not produce or advertise a Content-Type. The header is set by whoever serves a `.conf` file over HTTP.

## S17. Automatic type conversions

- **S17.1** number → string (JSON-valid form) — §Automatic type conversions (L1235)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:35
  status: ✅
- **S17.2** boolean → string ("true" / "false") — §Automatic type conversions (L1237)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:178
  status: ✅
- **S17.3** string → number (JSON rules) — §Automatic type conversions (L1238)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:44; tests/coerce.test.ts:31
  status: ✅
- **S17.4** string → bool: `true`/`yes`/`on`/`false`/`no`/`off` — §Automatic type conversions (L1239)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:79; tests/coerce.test.ts:5
  status: ✅
- **S17.5** `"null"` → null when null requested — §Automatic type conversions (L1244)
  out-of-scope: spec L1244 describes conversion when **null type is explicitly requested** via a typed accessor. ts.hocon's API surface does not include a `getNull()` or null-requesting accessor — `get()` returns JS `null` naturally based on stored value type, with no conversion path from the string `"null"`. The spec clause is structurally inapplicable to ts.hocon's API model. Aligns with rs.hocon's identical determination (see [rs.hocon#81](https://github.com/o3co/rs.hocon/pull/81)).
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:507 — kept as a sanity check that quoted `"null"` is stored as a string scalar and unquoted `null` is stored as the null scalar; no type-conversion is exercised.
  status: ➖
- **S17.6** null → other type: error — §Automatic type conversions (L1252)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:527 (pin .fails for getString); tests/config.test.ts:532,537,542 (3 passing sub-rules)
  status: ⚠️ (3-of-4 partial; passing sub-rules are *incidentally* satisfied)
  `getNumber()`, `getBoolean()`, and `getList()` on a null-typed value throw `ConfigError`, but **not** because `requireScalar` enforces "no null→T conversion" — the impl coincidentally lacks a coercion path from `null` to numeric/boolean/array types, so the typed accessors fall through to "not a number / not a boolean / not an array" errors. The contract is not structurally enforced. `getString()` on null silently returns the raw string `"null"` and is pinned via `.fails`. When fixing #88, add a single explicit `valueType === 'null'` rejection at the `requireScalar` boundary so all four accessors become contract-enforced together. See issue #88.
- **S17.7** object → other type: error — §Automatic type conversions (L1254)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:549
  status: ✅
  `getString()`, `getNumber()`, `getBoolean()`, and `getList()` all throw `ConfigError` when the value is an object.
- **S17.8** array → other (except numeric-indexed): error — §Automatic type conversions (L1255)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:572
  status: ✅
  `getString()`, `getNumber()`, `getBoolean()`, and `getConfig()` all throw `ConfigError` when the value is an array.

## S18. Units format

- **S18.1** Number value taken as default unit — §Units format (L1279)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts (S18.1 describe block), tests/s18-units-default.test.ts (ud01-ud08)
  status: ✅
  notes: Fixed in Phase 6 #3d (branch fix/s18-duration-default-unit). `parseDuration` and
  `parseBytes` now include an `if (unit === '')` branch that returns `num / divisor` (duration,
  default ms) or `Math.trunc(num) / divisor` (bytes, default B) before the unit-map lookup.
  The same fix resolves S18.4. `trimHoconWs()` helper added to use HOCON_WS character set
  instead of stdlib `trim()`. Scanner extended to accept `+` prefix.
- **S18.2** String parsed as: optional ws + number + ws + unit + ws — §Units format (L1281-1294)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:239
  status: ✅
- **S18.3** Unit name letters-only (Unicode L* / `isLetter`) — §Units format (L1287)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts (S18.3 describe block)
  status: ✅
  notes: Effectively enforced via the unit-name map lookup in `parseDuration`/`parseBytes`.
  Unknown units (including those with digits or hyphens) produce `NaN` → `ConfigError`.
  No explicit letter-only character check runs, but the outcome is conformant for all
  tested inputs. ⚠️ would apply only if a non-letter unit string happened to match a
  map key — which is structurally impossible given the map's contents.
- **S18.4** String with no unit → interpreted with default unit — §Units format (L1290)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts (S18.4 describe block), tests/s18-units-default.test.ts (ud01-ud08, ub01-ub06, un01-un03)
  status: ✅
  notes: Fixed in Phase 6 #3d alongside S18.1 — same fix site. The `if (unit === '')` branch
  in `parseDuration`/`parseBytes` handles both number-value (S18.1) and string-value (S18.4)
  paths, since both route `v.raw` through the same parse helper. Fractional duration strings
  (e.g. `"500.5"`) accepted and returned as ms (Lightbend double-parse faithful). Fractional
  byte strings (e.g. `"1024.5"`) accepted and truncated via `Math.trunc` (Lightbend
  `BigDecimal.toBigInteger()` faithful). `getBytes()` rejects negative byte sizes
  (Lightbend positive-only accessor invariant). xx.hocon fixtures ud01-ud08, ub01-ub06,
  un01-un03 pass. Period fixtures up01-up05 inapplicable — `getPeriod` not implemented (S20 ➖).

## S19. Duration format

- **S19.1** `ns` / `nano` / `nanos` / `nanosecond` / `nanoseconds` — §Duration format (L1307)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:264

  tests: tests/config.test.ts:254
  status: ✅
- **S19.8** Duration unit names are case sensitive (lowercase only) — §Duration format (L1304)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts (S19.8 describe block)
  status: ❌
  notes: `parseDuration` applies `.toLowerCase()` to the unit string before lookup, making
  unit names case-insensitive. Probe: `"5 MS"` → 5, `"5 Seconds"` → 5000, `"5 DAYS"` →
  432000000. Spec L1304: "The supported unit strings for duration are case sensitive and must
  be lowercase." Fix: remove the `.toLowerCase()` call in `parseDuration` and rely on the
  exact map keys. Tests pinned with `it.fails`.

## S20. Period format

- **S20.1** `d` / `day` / `days` — §Period Format (L1327)
  out-of-scope: Period Format mirrors `java.time.Period`, a JVM-specific type; the spec text (L1316-1318) explicitly references this Java API. None of the three implementations exposes a period parser/API.

## S21. Size in bytes format

- **S21.1** `B` / `b` / `byte` / `bytes` — §Size in bytes format (L1361)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:313
  status: ✅
- **S21.2** Powers of 10 (kB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB, YB + long forms) — §Size in bytes format (L1365)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:318; tests/config.test.ts:328
  status: ✅
- **S21.3** Powers of 2 (K/Ki/KiB, M/Mi/MiB, ...) — §Size in bytes format (L1376)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:323; tests/config.test.ts:333
  status: ✅
- **S21.4** Single-letter abbreviations → powers of 2 (java -Xmx convention) — §Size in bytes format (L1385)
  tests: tests/spec-s21-4-single-letter-bytes.test.ts; tests/conformance/byte-single-letter.test.ts; tests/config.test.ts (S21.4 block); tests/s18-units-default.test.ts (ub05)
  status: ✅
  notes: Fixed in Phase 6 #3h. `BYTE_UNITS` in `src/coerce.ts` now includes K/k/M/m/G/g/T/t/P/p/E/e
  as powers-of-two per HOCON.md L1385 (Lightbend typesafe-config 1.4.3 verified). Values exceeding
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (e.g. 1E = 2^60) throw `RangeError`. Z/Y deferred (overflow BigInt scope).
- **S21.5** Fractional values supported (`0.5M`) — §Units format (L1281-1294) + §Size in bytes (L1335-1342)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:384
  status: ✅

## S22. Config object merging API

- **S22.1** `merge(A, B)` semantics = duplicate-key behavior — §Config object merging (L1402)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts:157
  status: ✅
- **S22.2** Intermediate non-object hides earlier object across files — §Config object merging (L1406)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts (S22.2 describe block)
  status: ❌
  notes: `deepMergeHocon` always recursively merges objects regardless of intermediate
  non-object values. Probe: `c1({a:{x:1}}).withFallback(c2({a:42})).withFallback(c3({a:{y:2}}))`
  → `{a:{x:1,y:2}}`. Expected per spec L1410-1417: `{a:{x:1}}` (the non-object `42` in c2
  prevents c1's `{x:1}` from merging with c3's `{y:2}`). Fix requires `withFallback` /
  `deepMergeHocon` to track value-sequence history per key, not just the current types.
  Tests pinned with `it.fails`.
- **S22.3** Setting key to null clears earlier object value — §Config object merging (L1436)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts (S22.3 describe block)
  status: ✅

## S23. Java properties mapping

- **S23.1** Split key on `.` preserving empty strings — §Java properties (L1450)
  tests: tests/properties.test.ts:30
  status: ✅
- **S23.2** Empty path elements (leading/trailing) preserved — §Java properties (L1456)
  tests: tests/properties.test.ts (S23.2 describe block)
  status: ✅
- **S23.3** Properties values are always strings — §Java properties (L1471)
  tests: tests/properties.test.ts:37; tests/parse.test.ts:386
  status: ✅
- **S23.4** Object wins over string on conflicting key — §Java properties (L1485)
  tests: tests/spec-s23-4-properties-object-wins.test.ts; tests/conformance/properties-conflict.test.ts; tests/properties.test.ts (S23.4 describe block)
  status: ✅
  notes: Fixed in Phase 6 #3h. `parseProperties()` in `src/internal/properties/properties.ts`
  now collects all pairs and sorts by key before calling `setNested`, ensuring input-order
  independence. `setNested` last-segment write guards on existing-object presence (object wins).
  The reverse order (string first, dotted key second) already works correctly.
  Tests pinned with `it.fails`.
- **S23.5** Multi-line values (backslash continuation) — §Note on Java properties similarity (L1587)
  out-of-scope: declared in each implementation's README — the `.properties` reader supports only basic `key=value` syntax to avoid pulling a full Java properties parser into a non-JVM library.
  tests: —
  status: ➖
- **S23.6** Unicode escapes in `.properties` — §Note on Java properties similarity (L1587)
  out-of-scope: same rationale as S23.5.
  tests: —
  status: ➖

## S24. Conventional config files (JVM)

- **S24.1** `reference.conf` classpath merge — §Conventional configuration files (L1502)
  out-of-scope: relies on classpath resource resolution (see S14a.4).
  tests: —
  status: ➖
- **S24.2** `application.{conf,json,properties}` default load — §Conventional configuration files (L1506)
  out-of-scope: relies on classpath resource resolution (see S14a.4).
  tests: —
  status: ➖

## S25. System property override

- **S25.1** System properties override config file values — §Conventional override (L1530)
  out-of-scope: JVM system properties are a JVM-only mechanism; non-JVM runtimes use environment variables or library-specific overrides.
  tests: —
  status: ➖

## S26. Substitution fallback to environment variables

- **S26.1** Env var lookup when substitution not in config tree — §Substitution fallback (L1536)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:130; tests/parse.test.ts:35
  status: ✅
- **S26.2** Empty env var preserved as empty string (not undefined) — §Substitution fallback (L1558)
  tests: tests/config.test.ts (S26.2 describe block)
  status: ✅
- **S26.3** Env var SecurityException → treated as not present — §Substitution fallback (L1560)
  out-of-scope: `SecurityException` is a JVM-specific exception type; non-JVM runtimes have no equivalent guard at this layer.
  tests: —
  status: ➖
- **S26.4** Env vars always become strings (with auto type conversion) — §Substitution fallback (L1563)
  tests: tests/resolver.test.ts:113
  status: ✅
